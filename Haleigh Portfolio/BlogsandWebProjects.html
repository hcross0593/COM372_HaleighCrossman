<p>This is my professional blog. It is called <a href="http://hcrossman.us">hcrossman.us</a> This blog was originally started for a communications class at my school, and it has since turned into a passion of mine. The blog is mainly about military news, mainly the Army, but I also report on different military issues and events. I try to give my opinion on everything on which I report. I plan to continue this blog to sharpen my blogging skills as well as to keep my readers and community actively involved and interested in important issues. Leave me some comments about it!</p>
<p>This is my personal blog. It is called <a href="http://vintagecoffeebeans.wordpress.com">vintagecoffeebeans.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p>I am considering starting a third blog in order to review books. This idea is still in the very early stages, so I do not have a link for it yet. Check back soon to see the progress that I have made with it. If you have any suggestions about and/or for it, feel free to contact me!</p>
<p>I helped edit this webpage for a social media coordinator. The website is <a href="http://nightofterror.com">nightofterror.com</a> The specific page that I helped to edit is here:<a href="http://nightofterror.com/home/attractions/mayhemofdarkness">http://nightofterror.com/home/attractions/mayhemofdarkness</a>During the summer of 2014, I worked for the President of Cequix Technology Solutions, a newly founded company started in the fall of 2013. Redesigning the Night of Terror website was one of many projects for this company. As stated previously, my boss was the social media coordinator for the Night of Terror event. In addition to being a social media coordinator, he also offers many other services for businesses. Check out his website here: <a href="http://cequix.com/wp/">http://cequix.com/wp/</a></p>
