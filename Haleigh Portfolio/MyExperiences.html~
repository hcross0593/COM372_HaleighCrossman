<h2>Welcome to my work experience and coursework page!</h2>
<p>My coursework displayed here is relevant not only to web design and communications, but also to my English major, since I hope to one day work in that field. Both my work experience and my coursework are quite varied, so I hope to show my interests and skills in many different areas.</p>
